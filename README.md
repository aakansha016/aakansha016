## 🌟 Aakansha Choudhary 

Hey! I’m Aakansha — a **CS grad** with an obsession for turning **data into insight** and **logic into elegance**.

Landing an interview with Citadel, even though I didn’t get the job, was a turning point. It sparked my curiosity and pushed me to start learning quantitative finance and AI systems on my own. Later, I applied to my dream MBA program, but didn’t get in due to lack of work experience. Still, that rejection just reinforced what I’d already discovered: I didn’t need permission to chase what intrigued me. Whether it’s untangling messy market data, building intelligent underwriting tools, or architecting clean, scalable systems — this is the kind of work I’m meant to do.


> I don’t drink coffee. I run on clarity, clean code, and playlists that know what I need before I do.


### ⚡ What Drives Me
- Building intelligent tools that actually get used
- Creating backend systems that don’t just scale — they think
- Learning faster than the algorithm that’s trying to beat me
