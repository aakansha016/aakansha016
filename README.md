## 🌟 Aakansha Choudhary — Not Your Average Coder

Hey! I’m Aakansha — a **CS grad turned backend whisperer** with an obsession for turning **data into insight** and **logic into elegance**.

When I didn’t get into my dream MBA (thanks, work experience), I didn’t sulk — I recalibrated. Now, I’m diving deep into **quant finance**, **AI systems**, and everything that makes complex things feel *effortless*. Whether it’s decoding market data, building an AI-powered underwriting tool, or just making a backend feel seamless — I’m in my element.

> I don’t drink coffee. I run on clarity, clean code, and playlists that know what I need before I do.

### ⚡ What Drives Me
- Building intelligent tools that actually get used
- Creating backend systems that don’t just scale — they think
- Learning faster than the algorithm that’s trying to beat me
